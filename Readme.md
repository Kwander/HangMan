Hangman game

A traditional word guessing game. The player is required to guess the random word letter by letter. If the answer's letter exists in the word, the program record the guess. The cycle repeats until the whole word is guessed. If the player fails to answer correctly, a single health point is lost. 6 health points end the game.

The game is inplemented in Ruby as a side project to expand the knowledge of the language and to put the theory into practice. At the moment it is a console application with a minimalistic graphical interface.

Goals:
- Clean code
- Decent GUI (windows like)
- Images
- Sounds
- Standalone application (executable, multiplatform)
- Chat
